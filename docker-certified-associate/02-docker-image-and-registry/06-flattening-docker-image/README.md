# Flattening Docker Image

In this guide, our main objective will be to explore the process of flattening a Docker image's file system into a single layer. This technique allows us to consolidate the layers of a multi-layer image into a unified layer, streamlining the image structure. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you will gain a thorough understanding of how to effectively flatten Docker images and optimize their file systems.

## Introduction

In certain exceptional cases, there may arise a need to flatten the file system of a multi-layer image into a solitary layer. Although Docker lacks a straightforward command to achieve this, we can accomplish the task by exporting a container's filesystem and subsequently importing it as an image. In the following tutorial, we will explore the process of flattening an image's filesystem into a single layer.

## Tutorial Reference

1. Set up a new project directory to create a basic image:

    ```shell
    cd ~/
    mkdir alpine-hello
    cd alpine-hello
    vi Dockerfile
    ```

2. Create a Dockerfile that will result in a multi-layered image:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM alpine:3.9.3
    RUN echo "Hello, World!" > message.txt
    CMD cat message.txt
    ```

3. Build the image and check how many layers it has:

    ```shell
    docker build -t nonflat .
    docker image history nonflat
    ```

4. Run a container from the image and export its file system to an archive:

    ```shell
    docker run -d --name flat_container nonflat
    docker export flat_container > flat.tar
    ```

5. Import the archive to a new image and check how many layers the new image has:

    ```shell
    cat flat.tar | docker import - flat:latest
    docker image history flat
    ```

## Relevant Documentation

For more information about Docker image commands, refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image/).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, understanding how to flatten a Docker image's file system into a single layer is a valuable skill for managing Docker images effectively. By consolidating the layers of a multi-layer image, we can streamline the image structure and optimize its performance. The process involves exporting a container's file system and importing it as a new image, resulting in a simplified and more efficient image configuration. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can confidently flatten Docker images, enhancing your image management capabilities and contributing to a more streamlined and organized Docker environment.
