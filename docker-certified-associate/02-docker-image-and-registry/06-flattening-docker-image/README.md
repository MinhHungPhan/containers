# Flattening Docker Image

In this guide, our main objective will be to explore the process of flattening a Docker image's file system into a single layer. This technique allows us to consolidate the layers of a multi-layer image into a unified layer, streamlining the image structure. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you will gain a thorough understanding of how to effectively flatten Docker images and optimize their file systems.

## Introduction

In certain exceptional cases, there may arise a need to flatten the file system of a multi-layer image into a solitary layer. Although Docker lacks a straightforward command to achieve this, we can accomplish the task by exporting a container's filesystem and subsequently importing it as an image. In the following tutorial, we will explore the process of flattening an image's filesystem into a single layer.

## Why Flatten a Docker Image?

Flattening a Docker image might be desired for several reasons, including:

- **Performance Optimization:** In some cases, a single-layered image may perform slightly better than a multi-layered one due to reduced overhead.
- **Simplicity:** A single layer can simplify the structure of an image, making it easier to understand or transfer.
- **Specialized Use Cases:** Certain environments or systems may benefit from the simplicity and potentially smaller size of a single-layered image.

However, it's important to approach image flattening with caution, as the benefits of Docker's layered architecture usually outweigh the advantages of a single-layered image.

## Docker Container File System

When a Docker container is running, it has its own isolated file system. This file system is layered on top of the image it was started from, and any changes made inside the container (such as adding, removing, or modifying files) are written to this writable layer. The file system includes:

- **All the application files:** The executable files, scripts, binaries, and libraries required to run the application.
- **Dependencies:** Any software or packages that the application depends on to run.
- **Configuration files:** Custom configuration files for the application or system settings.
- **User data:** Any data generated by the application during its runtime or added by the user.

## Exporting and Importing with Docker

- **Exporting a container (`docker export`):** When you export a container using `docker export`, Docker creates a tar archive of the container's file system. This does not include the contents of volumes attached to the container but includes everything else. The resulting tar file is a snapshot of the container's file system at the time of export.

- **Importing with `docker import`:** The `docker import` command is used to create a new Docker image from a tar archive. When you import the tar file created by `docker export`, you're essentially creating a new image that contains a single layer with all the files and directories that were in the original container's file system. This new image does not retain the history or layer information of the original image from which the container was started.

## Tutorial Reference

1. Set up a new project directory to create a basic image:

```shell
cd ~/
mkdir alpine-hello
cd alpine-hello
vi Dockerfile
```

2. Create a Dockerfile that will result in a multi-layered image:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.9.3
RUN echo "Hello, World!" > message.txt
CMD cat message.txt
```

3. Build the image and check how many layers it has:

```shell
docker build -t nonflat .
docker image history nonflat
```

4. Run a container from the image and export its file system to an archive:

```shell
docker run -d --name flat_container nonflat
docker export flat_container > flat.tar
```

5. Import the archive to a new image and check how many layers the new image has:

```shell
cat flat.tar | docker import - flat:latest
docker image history flat
```

This command is used to create a new Docker image from a tar archive, in this case, `flat.tar`. The command is split into two parts, connected by a pipe (`|`). Here's a breakdown of what each part does and how they work together:

- `cat flat.tar`
   - `cat` is a standard Unix utility that reads files and outputs their content to the standard output. In this case, `cat` reads the contents of `flat.tar`, which is a tar archive file. A tar archive (`tar` stands for Tape Archive) is a collection of files and directories stored in a single file. In the context of Docker, a tar archive created by `docker export` contains the file system of a container, which can include the application, its dependencies, and any necessary configuration files.

- `|` (pipe)
   - The pipe character is used in Unix and Unix-like systems to pass the output of one command (in this case, `cat flat.tar`) as the input to another command (in this case, `docker import`). This allows the data being streamed out of the tar file to be directly fed into the Docker import command without needing to save it as an intermediate file.

- `docker import - flat:latest`
   - `docker import` creates a Docker image from a tar archive. The tar archive is expected to be received from the standard input (stdin), which is indicated by the `-` (dash) character. This means Docker import will use the data piped to it from `cat flat.tar` as the source for the image.
   - `flat:latest` specifies the name and tag for the newly created Docker image. In this case, `flat` is the name of the image, and `latest` is the tag. Docker tags are a way to refer to different versions of the same image, with `latest` conventionally used to refer to the most recent version.

When you run `cat flat.tar`, the command reads the binary content of the `flat.tar` file and sends it directly to stdout. This binary stream includes:

- **File headers** that contain metadata about each file (like name, size, permissions, and timestamps).
- **File content** for all the files and directories that were included in the archive when it was created.

Since the output is binary data, displaying it directly in a terminal with `cat` is not useful for human understanding and can often result in a cluttered display of non-printable characters. This is why, in the context of Docker and the command `cat flat.tar | docker import - flat:latest`, the output of `cat` is not meant to be read by humans but to be piped directly into another command (`docker import`) that can process this binary stream to create a Docker image from the archived file system.

In summary, `cat flat.tar | docker import - flat:latest` reads the contents of `flat.tar`, then pipes that data directly into `docker import`, which uses it to create a new Docker image named `flat` with the tag `latest`. This process effectively transforms the file system stored in the tar archive into a Docker image, allowing you to deploy or run containers from this new image.

## Best Practices

- **Use Sparingly:** Flatten images only when necessary, as multiple layers are generally beneficial for image management and efficiency.
- **Optimize Before Flattening:** Remove unnecessary files and optimize your Dockerfile before flattening to ensure the single layer is as small as possible.
- **Understand the Implications:** Be aware that flattening an image removes the history and metadata, potentially affecting debugging and traceability.

## Key Takeaways

- Flattening a Docker image consolidates its layers into a single one, which can be useful for performance optimization and simplification in specific scenarios.
- The process involves running a container from the image, exporting its filesystem, and importing that filesystem as a new image.
- It's a specialized technique and not typically recommended for general use due to the advantages of Docker's layered filesystem.
