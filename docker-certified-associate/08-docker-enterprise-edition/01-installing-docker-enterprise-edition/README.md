## Introduction

In this lesson, we explore the installation process for Docker Enterprise Edition, a licensed version of Docker with additional features.

## Background on Docker Editions

Previously in this course, we covered the Docker Community Edition (Docker CE), which is free and open-source. It offers core Docker engine features, including Docker swarm with swarm orchestration, networking, and security. The Community Edition has all the core functionalities necessary for most Docker users.

However, there's a licensed version known as Docker Enterprise Edition (Docker EE) that provides additional features for larger-scale, enterprise needs.

## Difference between Docker CE and Docker EE

Docker Community Edition (CE) is a free and open-source version of Docker that contains the core features of the Docker engine. With Docker CE:

- You receive all Docker engine updates.
- It includes Docker swarm with orchestration, networking, and security.
- It provides all the fundamental features required for Docker usage.

On the other hand, Docker Enterprise Edition offers:

- All the features of Docker CE.
- Universal Control Plane (UCP) - a web interface to manage Docker infrastructure.
- Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) - a Docker registry with advanced features.
- Vulnerability scanning for Docker images.
- Federated application management.

## Prerequisites

1. Three servers: 
- Large: Universal Control Plane Manager server.
- Small: UCP Worker.
- Medium: Docker Trusted Registry server.

If you're using a service like Cloud Playground, select the Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver LTS image for these servers.
   
2. Knowledge of Docker Community Edition.

3. Knwoledge of Mirantis LaunchPad.

## Mirantis Overview

Mirantis is a cloud technology company specializing in Kubernetes, containers, and formerly, OpenStack. They offer services, software, and training around these technologies, helping businesses navigate the modern cloud ecosystem.

### Key Points:

- **Historical Focus on OpenStack**: Mirantis was once deeply involved in the OpenStack community, offering support, training, and professional services.
  
- **Shift to Kubernetes & Containers**: Over time, Mirantis transitioned its focus towards the cloud-native landscape, emphasizing Kubernetes and containers.

- **Acquisition of Docker Enterprise**: In 2019, they acquired Docker Enterprise, gaining a suite of products designed to deploy containers at scale.

- **Services & Training**: Mirantis provides Kubernetes-as-a-service solutions and offers training/certifications in Kubernetes and Docker.

## Docker Enterprise Features

Docker Enterprise Edition, owned by Mirantis, encompasses all features of Docker CE and introduces new functionalities:

1. **Universal Control Plane (UCP):** A web interface for Docker infrastructure management.
2. **Docker Trusted Registry (DTR):** A Docker registry with advanced features surpassing the free Docker registry's capabilities.
3. **Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated security scans for Docker images.
4. **Federated Application Management:** Centralized application management system.

In essence, Docker Enterprise Edition simplifies application management at an enterprise scale.

## Installing Docker EE

To get started with Docker EE, follow the steps outlined below:

1. **Prepare Your Servers**:
   
- Ensure you have three provisioned servers.
- Enable passwordless sudo for `cloud_user` on all three servers using `sudo visudo`:

```bash
sudo visudo
```

- At the bottom of the file, add `cloud_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`

2. **Set Up SSH Authentication**:

- On the UCP Manager server, create an SSH key `ssh-keygen -t rsa`:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

- Copy this key to all three servers using the `ssh-copy-id` utility:

```bash
ssh-copy-id cloud_user@<manager_private_IP>
ssh-copy-id cloud_user@<worker_private_IP>
ssh-copy-id cloud_user@<dtr_private_IP>
```

3. **Install Mirantis Launchpad**:

- Download the desired version of Launchpad, e.g., `wget [URL]`:

```bash
wget https://github.com/Mirantis/launchpad/releases/download/0.14.0/launchpad-linux-x64
```

- Rename and make the file executable:

```bash
mv launchpad-linux-x64 launchpad
chmod +x launchpad
```

- Verify that we can execute launchpad:

```bash
./launchpad version
```

4. **Register Your Docker EE Cluster**:

- Run `./launchpad register` and provide the necessary information.

```bash
./launchpad register
```

5. **Configure Your Cluster**:

- Create a configuration file `cluster.yaml`:

```bash
vi cluster.yaml
```

- Define the list of hosts, their roles (Manager/Worker), SSH details, etc.
- Provide specific configurations for utilities, such as UCP.

```yaml
apiVersion: launchpad.mirantis.com/v1beta3
kind: DockerEnterprise
metadata:
  name: launchpad-ucp
spec:
  ucp:
    version: 3.3.2
    installFlags:
    - --admin-username=admin
    - --admin-password=secur1ty!
    - --default-node-orchestrator=kubernetes
  hosts:
  - address: <manager_private_IP>
    privateInterface: ens5
    role: manager
    ssh:
      user: cloud_user
      keyPath: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  - address: <worker_private_IP>
    privateInterface: ens5
    role: worker
    ssh:
      user: cloud_user
      keyPath: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

6. **Install Docker EE**:

- Build the UCP cluster using `./launchpad apply`:

```bash
./launchpad apply
```

7. **Access Docker EE UCP**:

- Access the UCP interface using a web browser at `https://<UCP_Manager_IP_Address>`.
- Log in with the admin credentials you specified.
