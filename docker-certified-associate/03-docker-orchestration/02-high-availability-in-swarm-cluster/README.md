## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into the principles of high availability within a swarm cluster. The focus will be on understanding the function of multiple swarm managers, the importance of maintaining a consistent swarm state, and the balance between fault tolerance and performance. 

Moreover, we'll explore the Raft consensus algorithm, the concept of a quorum, and the distribution of swarm managers across availability zones. These topics are fundamental for any professional planning to take the Docker Certified Associate exam.

## High Availability

When discussing high availability in Docker swarm, we refer to the functionality of a swarm cluster even when some swarm managers are unreachable. A high availability configuration leverages multiple swarm managers to ensure the swarm remains operational under various conditions.

## The Raft Consensus Algorithm

Docker swarm uses the Raft consensus algorithm to maintain a consistent cluster state across multiple managers. This algorithm facilitates communication among managers, ensuring that the swarm's state is consistent across all members. However, a higher number of managers also implies more network communication, thereby affecting the performance. Hence, while designing a cluster, it is crucial to consider both high availability and performance.

## Quorum

### Concepts

Quorum, an essential concept in the Raft consensus algorithm, refers to more than half of the managers in the swarm. It's crucial to understand that achieving a quorum requires more than half, not equal to half, of the swarm managers. For instance, in a swarm with five managers, the quorum would be three managers.

A quorum is required to make changes to the cluster state. If the swarm loses its quorum due to communication issues or manager downtime, no changes can be made to the cluster state. This restriction implies that new tasks cannot be scheduled, existing tasks cannot be modified, and nodes cannot be added or removed.

### Example

Understanding quorum can indeed be a bit tricky. Let's break it down with a simple example.

Imagine a small committee responsible for making decisions. This committee has 5 members. For any decision to be valid, a majority of the members must agree. This is where the concept of a quorum comes into play.

**What is a Quorum?**

- A quorum is the minimum number of members that must be present (or in case of a computer network, operational) to make the proceedings of that group valid.
- In our example, the quorum would be more than half of 5, which means at least 3 members.

**Why More Than Half?**

- The idea behind requiring more than half is to ensure that any decision made represents the majority opinion.
- If only half or fewer members are present, it's possible for a decision to not truly reflect what most of the group wants.

**Example Scenarios:**

1. **3 out of 5 Members Present:**

- This meets the quorum. Decisions made are valid because at least 3 (more than half) are present.

2. **5 out of 5 Members Present:**

- Clearly, this meets the quorum. Any decision reflects the majority view.

3. **2 out of 5 Members Present:**

- This does not meet the quorum. Decisions cannot be made because less than half are present. It's not representative of the majority.

**Translating to a Computer Cluster:**

- In a computer cluster, nodes (computers) act like committee members. 
- A 3-node cluster is like a committee of 3. If 1 node is down, 2 are still up. This is like having 2 out of 3 members present, which is more than half, so the quorum is met.
- A 4-node cluster is like a committee of 4. If 2 nodes are down, only 2 are up. This is like having 2 out of 4 members present, which is exactly half, not more. So, the quorum is not met.

By requiring more than half, the system ensures that any decision or action has the backing of a majority of the cluster, thus preventing minority rule and ensuring stability and consistency in decisions.

## Fault Tolerance and Performance

It's worth noting that having an even number of swarm managers does not necessarily improve fault tolerance due to the way quorum operates. For example, a four-manager cluster requires a three-manager quorum, meaning you can only afford to lose one manager - the same as a three-manager cluster. Therefore, when adding managers to a three-node cluster, it's better to add two more to achieve a five-manager cluster where two managers can be lost while still maintaining a quorum. 

## Availability Zones

Docker recommends spreading swarm managers across at least three availability zones when setting up a multi-manager cluster. These zones could be different racks in a physical datacenter or even different datacenters altogether, increasing redundancy and reducing the impact of a single point of failure. 

However, maintaining a quorum should also be considered when distributing the swarm managers. Ensure that losing any one of the three availability zones will still maintain the quorum.

```c#
+---------------+-------------------------------+
| Manager Nodes | Availability Zone Distribution|
+---------------+-------------------------------+
|       3       |              1-1-1            |
|       5       |              2-2-1            |
|       7       |              3-2-2            |
|       9       |              3-3-3            |
+---------------+-------------------------------+
```

This table illustrates the number of Docker manager nodes and how they are distributed across three Availability Zones (AZ 1, AZ 2, AZ 3) to achieve high availability. The distribution aims to balance the nodes as evenly as possible across the AZs.
