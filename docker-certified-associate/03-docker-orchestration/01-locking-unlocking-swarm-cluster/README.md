## Introduction

In Docker Swarm, sensitive data such as raft logs on swarm managers and TLS communication between swarm nodes are encrypted. This encryption ensures security by preventing exposure of sensitive information. Autolock takes this a step further by securing the encryption keys themselves. 

## About Docker Swarm Autolock

By default, the keys used for encryption are stored unencrypted on your swarm managers' disks. This arrangement could potentially expose these keys to an attacker who gains access to the system. Autolock, however, adds an extra layer of security by locking these keys. When autolock is enabled, the encryption keys are not stored in an unencrypted form. Instead, an unlock key is provided which is needed to unlock the swarm every time Docker restarts on a manager.

## Enabling Autolock

By default, autolock is disabled. To enable autolock, use the `docker swarm update` command with the `--autolock=true` flag. This action will provide an unlock key that you should securely store as it will be necessary to unlock the swarm after every Docker restart. If you're setting up a new Docker swarm, you can enable autolock from the start with `docker swarm init --autolock=true`.

```bash
docker swarm init --autolock=true
```

## Working with Autolock

Once autolock is enabled, it requires manual intervention whenever Docker restarts on a manager. To unlock the swarm, use the `docker swarm unlock` command and provide the unlock key when prompted. The `docker swarm unlock-key` command can be used to retrieve the unlock key if it is lost, provided a swarm manager is still up and running. It is also possible to rotate the unlock key automatically with `docker swarm unlock-key --rotate`, but make sure to keep a note of the new key and retain the old key temporarily until the new key propagates across the swarm.

## Disabling Autolock

If you wish to disable autolock, you can do so using the `docker swarm update --autolock=false` command. Once autolock is disabled, you do not need to unlock the swarm after a Docker restart.

```bash
docker swarm update --autolock=false
```

## Tutorial Reference

1. Enable autolock: 

```bash
docker swarm update --autolock=true
```

2. Save the unlock key in a secure location.

3. Verify that the swarm is locked after Docker restart: 

```bash
docker node ls
sudo systemctl restart docker
docker node ls
```

Expected output:

```plaintext
Error response from daemon: Swarm is encrypted and needs to be unlocked before it can be used. Use "docker swarm unlock" to unlock it.
```

4. Unlock the swarm:

```bash
docker swarm unlock
```

5. Retrieve the existing unlock key: 

```bash
docker swarm unlock-key
```

6. Rotate the unlock key: 

```bash
docker swarm unlock-key --rotate
```

7. Disable autolock: 

```bash
docker swarm update --autolock=false
sudo systemctl restart docker
docker node ls
```

# Conclusion

Through this tutorial, you've gained a deeper understanding of Docker Swarm's Autolock feature. You now know how to enable, disable, and work with Autolock. Moreover, you've learned how to interact with your swarm, recover or rotate your unlock key, and manage the security of your Docker Swarm clusters more effectively. 

Understanding the underlying features and mechanics of Docker Swarm, such as Autolock, is essential to properly maintain the security and efficiency of your swarm clusters. As you continue to work with Docker Swarm, these skills will become an invaluable part of your toolset.

Happy swarming!
