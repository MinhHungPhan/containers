## Introduction

Welcome to the Docker Engine Upgrade Guide. When using Docker to manage containers, it is crucial to keep the Docker Engine up-to-date. This guide will walk you through the process of both downgrading and upgrading the Docker Engine on Ubuntu Server. Whether you need to install a newer version or revert to a previous one, this guide has got you covered.

## Downgrading to a Previous Version

Before upgrading to a new version, it's essential to downgrade Docker to ensure a smooth transition. Follow these steps to downgrade Docker to a previous version:

1. Stop Docker by running the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop docker
```

2. Remove the Docker packages using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli
```

> Note: Don't worry, removing the packages will not delete your containers.

3. Update the local package listings:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

4. Install the earlier version of Docker using the package string. Run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce=5:18.09.4~3-0~ubuntu-bionic docker-ce-cli=5:18.09.4~3-0~ubuntu-bionic
```

Ensure that you replace the version string with the desired version you want to downgrade to.

5. Verify the Docker version by executing the following command:

```bash
docker version
```

The output should display the downgraded version you installed.

## Upgrading to a New Version

Upgrading Docker to a new version is a straightforward process. You don't need to stop Docker or remove any packages. Follow these steps to upgrade Docker to a newer version:

1. Install the new Docker packages using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce=5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic docker-ce-cli=5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic
```

Replace the version string with the desired version you want to upgrade to.

2. Verify the Docker version by running the following command:

```bash
docker version
```

The output should display the upgraded version you installed.
