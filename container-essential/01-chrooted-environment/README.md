# Chroot Command and Chrooted Environments

## Introduction
The chroot command changes the apparent root directory of a process, creating a chrooted environment with limited visibility of the system.

## Key Concepts

- Chrooted environments isolate files and directories, providing a restricted view of the system.
- Chrooting can be useful for creating containerized environments or restricting user access.
- The process involves creating a chrooted directory, adding necessary files and libraries, and configuring user permissions.
- A demonstration is provided for creating a chrooted environment named "kientree" with a user named "napoleon."
- Chrooting can be used to create restricted SSH environments for users.

## Demo Steps

1. Create a chrooted directory and necessary files.
2. Add user(s) to the chrooted environment.
3. Configure permissions and move required libraries.
4. Test the chrooted environment by logging in as the user.

## Usage

To try out chrooting, follow the steps provided in the demonstration. Keep in mind that additional libraries and commands may need to be added based on your specific requirements.

## Tutorial Reference

1. Create the `/home/kientree` directory:
```bash
mkdir /home/kientree
```
2. Add the "Napoleon" user:
```bash
useradd napoleon
```
3. Create the `bin` and `lib64` directories:
```bash
mkdir /home/kientree/{bin,lib64}
```
4. Copy the necessary binaries:
```bash
cp /bin/bash /home/kientree/bin/bash
cp /bin/ls /home/kientree/bin/ls
cp /bin/cat /home/kientree/bin/cat
```

5. Find the required libraries:
```bash
libs=$(ldd /bin/bash /bin/ls /bin/cat | awk '{print $3}' | grep -v "^$")
```
6. Copy the required libraries to `/home/kientree/lib64`:
```bash
echo "$libs" | xargs -I{} cp {} /home/kientree/lib64
```
7. Create the `waterloo.txt` file with the desired content:
```bash
echo "There is no escape!" > /home/kientree/waterloo.txt
```
8. Change the root directory to `/home/kientree` and run Bash:
```bash
chroot /home/kientree /bin/bash
```

## Conclusion

Chrooting provides a way to create isolated and container-like environments. By following the above steps, you will have successfully created a chrooted environment for the "Napoleon" user. This environment restricts access to specific binaries and libraries, providing a limited view of the system. Feel free to modify the steps according to your requirements and explore further possibilities with chrooted environments.
