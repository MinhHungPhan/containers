## History and Need for Containers

Containers emerged as a solution to the challenges of software development and deployment. They offer isolated environments, limiting what system calls, processes, and users can do, ensuring consistent performance across different platforms.

## Understanding Chroot

Chroot is a command that creates isolated file system environments. It's a foundational concept in understanding how containers provide secure and controlled execution of applications.

## Exploring Namespaces

Namespaces in container technology isolate a processâ€™s view of the operating system, ensuring that each process only sees its own resources, thus enhancing security and efficiency.

## Cgroups and Resource Management

Cgroups, or control groups, are a feature that limits and allocates the resources a process or set of processes can use. They play a crucial role in ensuring that each container only uses its fair share of resources.

## OS-level Virtualization vs Hypervisor-based Virtualization

Learn about the differences between OS-level virtualization, used in containers, and hypervisor-based virtualization. Understand how containers allow for more efficient use of system resources.

## Getting Started with LXD and LXC

LXC (Linux Containers) and LXD (pronounced "lex-dee") are both related to containerization but serve different purposes. LXC is an older technology that acts as a lightweight virtualization method to run multiple isolated Linux systems (containers) on a single control host. It focuses on process and network isolation and doesn't require a separate kernel for each container, making it an efficient form of virtualization.

On the other hand, LXD is built on top of LXC and is a container "hypervisor." It's designed to manage containers in a more user-friendly and scalable way. LXD is often likened to a traditional virtual machine hypervisor, but specifically for container management. It offers a REST API for remote management, advanced features like container snapshots, and a more intuitive user experience compared to LXC.

In essence, while LXC focuses on the container itself, LXD provides an additional layer that manages these containers, offering an enhanced and more manageable user experience.

## Container Management and User Interaction

Users can manage multiple isolated environments within a single system, each running its own instance of an operating system. This allows for the deployment and testing of applications in different OS environments without the need for multiple physical machines. Essentially, container management tools streamline the process of creating, running, and managing containers, enabling users to efficiently use computing resources and simplify the deployment of applications across various platforms.

## Understanding Linux Kernel and Containers

The Linux kernel plays a crucial role in container technology. It allows multiple isolated user space instances, or containers, to run on a single Linux host. These containers share the host kernel but maintain separate execution environments. The kernel manages system calls from these containers, ensuring they remain isolated and secure. This architecture allows different Linux distributions to coexist on the same host without interfering with each other, making it highly efficient for running multiple applications with varied environment requirements on a single physical server.

## Security in Containers: SELinux and AppArmor

SELinux, developed by the NSA, implements mandatory access controls (MAC) that restrict programs' capabilities based on defined policies, adding an extra layer of security. AppArmor, on the other hand, offers similar protection but focuses on restricting programs through defined profiles. Both systems effectively isolate containers and protect the host system from potential threats or breaches, making them essential for maintaining robust container security.

### SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)

- Developed by NSA for enforcing mandatory access controls (MAC).
- Restricts system processes and users to minimum necessary privileges.
- Prevents unauthorized access and contains the impact of security breaches.
- Policy-based system, offering granular control over security policies.

### AppArmor (Application Armor)

- Linux kernel security module for program-specific access control.
- Profiles define file and capability access for individual programs.
- Path-based system, simpler to configure compared to SELinux.
- Limits the potential impact of program exploits by confinement.
