## Introduction

LXC, also known as "Lexy", is a technology that stands for LX (Linux) Containers. It was developed in 2008 by IBM developers, leveraging Linux containment features such as cgroups, namespaces, and chroot. LXC provides a user-friendly interface, powerful API, and simple tools to manage containers on Linux systems. Additionally, LXD (Linux Daemon) acts as the daemon to communicate with LXC applications.

## Installation

To install LXC and LXD, follow these steps:

1. Determine your Linux distribution by checking `/etc/issue`:

```bash
cat /etc/issue
```

2. Install LXD and LXD client:

```bash
sudo apt install lxd lxd-client
```

> Note: If you are running a minimal cloud server image, you may need to install these packages manually.

3. Initialize LXD:

```bash
sudo lxd init
```

During the initialization process, you will be prompted to set up storage, configure network access, and configure the LXD bridge.

## Usage

Once LXD is set up, you can start using LXC containers. Here are some basic commands to get you started:

1. List available containers:

```bash
sudo lxc list
```

2. Launch an Ubuntu container:

```bash
lxc launch ubuntu:16.04 my-ubuntu
```

3. Launch an Alpine container:

```bash
lxc launch images:alpine/3.5 my-alpine
```

4. Execute a command inside a container:

```bash
lxc exec <container-name> <command>
```

5. Example: Execute a Bash shell inside the Ubuntu container:

```bash
lxc exec my-ubuntu bash
```

6. Example: Create a file inside the Alpine container:

```bash
lxc exec my-alpine -- sh -c 'echo "hello" > hi.txt'
```

## Remotes

LXC and LXD use remotes to host container images, similar to repositories. To view available remotes, use the following command:

```bash
lxc remote list
```

Ensure that you only pull images from trusted sources, such as official distributions or trusted repositories.
