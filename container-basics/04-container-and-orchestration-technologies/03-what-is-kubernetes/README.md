## Introduction

Welcome to the guide on Kubernetes, the leading orchestration tool for container management. This guide is designed to provide you with a foundational understanding of Kubernetes and its significance in the modern cloud infrastructure.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source platform that automates Linux container operations. It eliminates many of the manual processes involved in deploying and scaling containerized applications. In this section, we'll explore what Kubernetes is and how it can benefit you.

## Key Features of Kubernetes

- **Self-Healing Applications**: Kubernetes can automatically restart containers that fail, replace them, and shut down containers that don't respond to your user-defined health check.
- **Automated Scaling**: Based on the utilization of your services, Kubernetes can automatically scale the number of containers up or down.
- **Automated Deployments**: With Kubernetes, you can ensure that deployments are updated without downtime or errors.

## Getting Started with Kubernetes

Starting with Kubernetes involves understanding its components like pods, services, and deployments. The following example will walk you through a basic deployment process:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

This YAML file is a basic specification for a Kubernetes deployment that manages two replicas of a container running the Nginx web server.

## Alternatives to Kubernetes

After learning about Kubernetes, we'll compare it with other orchestration tools available in the market to help you make an informed decision.
